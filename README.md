# Smartthings-and-Home-Control
A workaround to make Home Control Socket supported by Smartthings. 

The codes are not made by me, but i'v made small changes to make it work. 

Recuire the creation of two virtual switches to make the smartapp to work.

The Device handler code can be edited to change the posision of the buttons to match the real world layout.

In my setup I'm using the "Home Control Home Control Stikkontakt dobbel u/jord HCOUTLETUE1"
